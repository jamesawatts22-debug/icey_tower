Icy Tower in Python & Turtle Graphics | @TheWannabeCoder
--------------------------------------------------------
This script is the main entry point for the game.
It initializes the screen, creates the player and platform objects,
and starts the main game loop for real-time updates.    

It handles:
- Screen setup and event bindings
- Initialization of game objects (player, platforms, UI)
- The core game loop that updates the screen
